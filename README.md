# Friendly-potato

Friendly-potato is a countdown app in which you can define an end date and the name of the event taking place on that day. The countdown starts from the current time and displays the time remaining to the chosen end date in the format of Days, Hours(h), Minutes(m), and Seconds(s). The input text is displayed as one line, always covering the entire screen width and resizing whenever necessary.
